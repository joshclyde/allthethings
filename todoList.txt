figure out compose function
add selectors
figure out best way to do redux stuff
how to add assets? (mp3 for metronome, png for chords)
how do i want to do chords?
  - CURRENT: function that takes in parameters and creates string representation
  - static images for each chord
  - dynamically create the image for each chord (basically overlaying images on top of each other)
make button component
make metronome component prettier
remove ticking from redux
metronome: could replace current stuff with animation instead of constantly changing radius?
