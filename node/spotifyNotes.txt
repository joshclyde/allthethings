if not registered user, needs to redirect to spotify/auth page
this gives us the authorization code which can be exchanged for an access token

Once we have the authorization code, we shouldn't ever need to call spotify/auth ever again.
Instead we will call spotify/token. This will return us
{
   "access_token": "NgCXRK...MzYjw",
   "token_type": "Bearer",
   "scope": "user-read-private user-read-email",
   "expires_in": 3600,
   "refresh_token": "NgAagA...Um_SHo"
}
The access token is temporary and is used to make calls to get real data.
The refresh token is important! We use this to get a new access token once it expires.

Access Token Expired
{
  "error": {
    "status": 401,
    "message": "The access token expired"
  }
}




NOTE: it looks like the auth code expires? so might want to look into that.
